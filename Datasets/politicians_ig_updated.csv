And we’re so grateful for all that they’re doing to keep us safe. Today, I’ll be sharing the story of a physician on the frontlines, Dr. Sherene Fakhran.⁣
⁣
Dr. Fakhran specializes in pulmonary and critical care and has been working at @cookcountyhealth Hospital in Chicago for the last ten years. These last few months have been difficult, but she credits the efforts of the entire hospital - the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, custodians, and support staff - for doing their part to keep the hospital going to tend to COVID-19 patients in critical need. ⁣
⁣
Dr. Fakhran shares more about her experience while working in the intensive care unit at Cook County Health: “A big part of what we do in the ICU is to communicate and build a relationship with the patients and families. Speaking with families has become more challenging. We also try to facilitate video calls with patients and families to help them feel connected or at times say goodbye. Although, I have been working with critically ill patients for many years, this experience has been very emotional.”⁣
⁣
“What gives me the most hope is how people have come together to support in whatever way they can––from bringing in food to making PPE for our staff. All the providers in our division have also done an outstanding job staying positive, supporting each other, and rising up to the challenge. Most importantly, seeing some of our sickest patients recover and actually go home has been the best feeling of all.”","['Best president ever!

We wanted to make sure they weren’t being left behind by helping them receive the mentorship, resources, and opportunities they deserved. ⁣
⁣
These past few weeks, the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance has been hosting virtual town halls to check-in with community leaders looking out for communities of color that have been hit especially hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. I had a chance to join one of these calls, and it looks like this bright kid here, Avi, tuned into our conversation.

Barack Obama,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_SdMnFD996/,image,"⁣On this day 50 years ago, millions of people from every corner of our country joined in common cause to demand basic protections to safeguard our planet for future generations. The first Earth Day helped transform the ways we interact with the world around us, and it changed how we viewed our impact on the natural world––inspiring the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and landmark legislation that protected the air we breathe, the water we drank, and the animals that lived alongside us. ⠀
⠀
Today, we’re reminded more than ever of the role we play–and the responsibility of our government––to ensure that we do not pass a world beyond repair on to our children. And that starts by not denying the evidence presented by scientists and climate activists around climate change. We must demand more from our government, return to the Paris Agreement, and work to lead the world in reducing the pollution that continues to cause climate change. And science is telling us to go much further––we must continue to accelerate progress on bold new green initiatives that make our economy a clean energy innovator. ⠀
⠀
When I think of the world I want to see in the future for my daughters––and the children across the world––I’m reminded that there is so much more we need to do to take care of the one planet we've got, and it’s up to all of us to demand and lead that change.","['One of my favorite trips—my first visit to Yosemite!', 'Thank you Sir for your care to our world....', 'Cant wait for you to be in jail', 'Stay out of our politics.

Barack Obama,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_F_FRdgP4V/,image,"⁣It doesn’t take a pandemic to see how vital mentorship programs are to our communities—they ensure young people, especially those growing up in underserved neighborhoods, don’t get left behind. I’d like to share the story of one mentorship organization going above and beyond in my hometown. ⠀
⠀
Since 2005, New Life Centers of Chicagoland, a MBK Alliance Seed Community partner organization, has been providing mentorship and outreach to kids in the Little Village, Brighton Park, Humboldt Park, and Midway neighborhoods. The idea is that mentors and youth “walk together” through life—not just in the big moments, but through all the milestones in between so they never have to feel like they’re alone.⠀
⠀
New Life Centers knew that this crisis wouldn’t just change the way their mentorship programming worked––they knew they had to adapt to meet the new needs of the youth they served. And for a lot of the families in their neighborhoods, the crisis has made a disproportionate impact. It meant hunger. It meant loss. But it didn’t mean losing hope. ⠀
⠀
Since Chicago started sheltering in place, New Life Centers has been safely distributing healthy food to more than 400 families a week. They’ve also kept up their mentoring, tutoring, street outreach and even deployed video game consoles for virtual tournaments to keep up a little joyful communication and competition while families stay home. They’re still making sure that no kid has to walk alone, even if they can’t walk together right now. ⠀
⠀
When you ask New Life Centers staff what keeps them motivated to see this work through, it’s an answer that rings true for so many organizations just like theirs: “Our young people keep us motivated. We know they’re facing the same challenges we are. And that’s why we do the work. We just want to make sure they know they have someone in their corner.”","['WE MISS YOU AND MICHELLE', 'Still my president', 'Trump2020', 'Barack Obama 2020', 'Shoulda stayed our president another 4 years', '🤡', 'I MISS YOU SO MUCH', 'Trump 2020', 'Like if you love trump', 'Hey Obama,love you miss you ❤️', 'please speak at columbia university’s commencement! we need you more than ever', 'Barack, please admit that you were too scared of Trump to run for a 3rd term and that America is the oldest country ever']","Apr 17, 2020",2020-04-17T19:21:30.000Z,,"577,927"

If there’s one thing we’ve learned as a country from moments of great crisis, it’s that the American spirit of looking out for one another can’t be restricted to our homes, or our workplaces, or our neighborhoods, or our houses of worship. It also has to be reflected in our national government. The kind of leadership that’s guided by knowledge and experience; honesty and humility; empathy and grace – that kind of leadership doesn’t just belong in our state capitols and mayors offices. It belongs in the White House.

“There are so, so many ways you can help. Buy a meal for the medical professionals and first responders working day and night to keep us healthy and safe.

All of that, was performed by governments around the world. Not big corporations (not that Im a huge fan of them either, but nevertheless). My point is Big Government is more dangerous than Big Companies, we need to be wary of both tho, since corporations can start acting like government when they get big enough. (which is could corporatism not capitalism, there is a large difference, capitalism would rarely ever become corporatism if it wasnt for government, and is actually what we have now in a multilayered way. My solution is no government, and an armed populace ready to take down corporations that decide they want to play government next. Check out Anarcho-Capitalism its very interesting.

Some of those complaints are barely legible, and many of the records are heavily redacted.\n\nIn October 1973, the Civil Rights Division filed a lawsuit against Trump Management Company, Donald Trump and his father Fred Trump, alleging that African-Americans and Puerto Ricans were systematically excluded from apartments. The Trumps responded with a $100 million countersuit accusing the government of defamation.\n\nDonald Trump denied any racial discrimination, but said his managers tried to weed out certain kinds of tenants. “What we didn’t do was rent to welfare cases, white or black,"" Trump wrote in a 1987 book.', ""@flyinevo2 You are right about Trump filing bankruptcy and screwing some companies which I don't agree with.

On April 1, 1979, the theocratic Islamic Republic of Iran was proclaimed. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who had returned to Iran from exile to assume command of the revolt, became Supreme Leader in December of that year. His rise was accelerated by the seizure on Nov. 4 of 52 American diplomats and citizens, and citizens of other countries, at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The hostage crisis became the means by which the Ayatollah crushed political opponents in Iran. Dealing with the hostage taking became the overwhelming political crisis for President Jimmy Carter. It lasted 444 days.\nVirtually all Americans—Democrats, Republicans and independents—united in support of the hostages and the international call for their freedom. One prominent political figure on the 2020 stage, then almost completely unknown, stood apart by joining a Marxist-Leninist party that not only pledged support for the Iranian theocracy, but also justified the hostage taking by insisting the hostages were all likely CIA agents.

Bernie's Back in Queens, New York, October 19
.
“I want you all to take a look around and find someone you don’t know. Maybe somebody who doesn’t look kind of like you, maybe somebody who might be of a different religion than you, maybe they come from a different country. My question now to you is: Are you willing to fight for that person who you don’t even know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself? Are you willing to stand together and fight for those people who are struggling economically in this country? Are you willing to fight for young people drowning in student debt, even if you are not? Are you willing to fight to ensure that every American has health care as a human right, even if you have good health care? Are you willing to fight for frightened immigrant neighbors, even if you are native born? Are you willing to fight for a future for generations of people who have not yet even been born, but are entitled to live on a planet that is healthy and habitable? Because if you are willing to do that, if you are willing to love, if you are willing to fight for a government of compassion and justice and decency, if you are willing to stand up to Trump's desire to divide us up, if you are prepared to stand up to the greed and corruption of the corporate elite, if you and millions of others are prepared to do that, there is no doubt in my mind that not only will we win this election, but together we will transform this country.""","['❤️', '👏👏👏👏', 'Our last chance to preserve democracy and have a president that serves all the people.Bernie has a good heart and good ideas.', 'Dear mr Bernie I hope so much for your country and the people in America that you will be the next president sending Hope from Denmark🙏🏻', '👏❤️', 'QB represent!

Kickoff at Navy Pier in Chicago, March 3

My time at the University of Chicago, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, changed my life and helped shape me into the person I am today.

In 1963 I was a student at the University of Chicago. It had been nine years since the Brown v Board of Education decision, but the school officials in Chicago had still refused to meaningfully desegregate the city’s public schools. Instead of putting black children in those empty classrooms, the school officials decided to put old trailers on the black school grounds. These trailers were a monstrosity. Students would boil in the heat, and freeze in the cold.

One day, many of us went to the spot where they planned to put the trailers. We were corralled by a police line and told not to cross that line. Well, some of us did. And, of course, we were arrested and thrown into paddy wagons. We spent that night in jail, until we were bailed out the next morning by the NAACP.

My activities in Chicago taught me a very important lesson. And that is that whether it is the struggle is against racism, or sexism, or homophobia, or corporate greed, or environmental devastation, or war and militarism or religious bigotry - real change never takes place from the top on down. It always takes place from the bottom on up when people, at the grassroots level, stand up and fight back. That's a lesson I learned in Chicago, and a lesson I've never forgotten.","['""Feel The Bern"" 😆', ""If you know then you know.

We’re seeing somebody run into a kid in Des Moines because that child is Latina. We’re seeing people being stabbed yesterday in New York because they are Jewish. And we are seeing people being assaulted because they are Muslim.

If there was ever a time in American history where we say no to religious bigotry, this is the time. If there was ever a time when we say no to divisiveness, this is that moment.

So I was delighted to be in Des Moines with Rabbi Yossi Jacobson tonight to celebrate the lighting of the Hanukkah candles, and to once again reaffirm our belief in an America where justice, freedom and religious freedom apply to all people—and to stand united to wipe out all forms of racism, discrimination and bigotry.","['What about hate and vandalism against Trump supporters by people on our side?', 'Had Bernie been in Germany during the 1940s he would have been convincing Jews to get on Hitlers trains!', 'Donated my $18', '@berniesanders the one and only.

But in a moment of choice, Americans all across this country took action. On April 22, 1970, 20 million people turned out to educate their communities and protest the degradation of our planet, launching the modern environmental movement.

It wasn’t a partisan issue. It wasn’t some ideological debate. Everyone could see that our planet was in peril. And by acting together, those activists seized the attention and the imagination of people all over the world, as well as leaders in Washington. Out of that first Earth Day came the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and a new mindset that awakened all of us to our responsibilities beyond just the world we leave our children — to ensuring that our one planet will provide for generations unborn.

This year, Earth Day comes amid global crises: the difficult, immediate, and undeniable reality of pandemic disease, and the existential threat of climate change — which we are already experiencing and which threatens equally deadly results in the near future if we fail to act. COVID-19 and the climate emergency both underscore the fragility of life on this planet, the connections that bind us to our fellow humans, and the responsibility we all have to meet these global threats with urgent action, ambitious plans, and every tool at our disposal.

That’s the responsibility I feel every time I look at my grandchildren and see their unlimited potential. Or when I hear from young activists who understand that inaction today is costing their futures. Today’s young people carry the same fierce spirit as those first Earth Day activists, and they are the reason I know we will succeed in spurring the world to finally raise our ambitions to meet the seriousness of this threat.

Senator Sanders endorsed our campaign today and I want to thank him not just for the endorsement, but for his leadership on making our country a more just, fairer place.

It’s voices like his that refuse to allow us to just accept what is — that refuse to accept we can’t change what’s wrong in our nation — and that refuse to accept the health and well-being of our fellow citizens and our planet isn’t our responsibility too.
He doesn't get enough credit for being a voice that forces us all to take a hard look in the mirror and ask if we’ve done enough. He has put the interest of the nation — and the need to defeat Donald Trump — above all else.
I’m excited to continue the work Bernie started in the months and years ahead. As he says: Not me, Us.

There’s growing private insurance in the UK with the set up of Schoen Clinic, Germany and Cleveland Clinic setting up a new hospital.\nAustralia, another eg of Medicare for all, now has 54 percent of the population with private insurance over and above social insurance to mitigate long waiting times and to ensure patient choice of physician.

Forty years later, one of those little boys, my son Beau, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only months to live. Through the hardship, I saw firsthand how important it is to have quality, affordable coverage — it means peace of mind that your medical bills won’t drown you in debt and helps provide hope that things will get better.

For a country as large and diverse as the US with each state having its own health system, trying to implement this one size fits all plan with ballooning budgets is set to fail. Other countries that Bernie and John Oliver in his recent episode alluded to such as the UK have significant challenges with the current state of the NHS, where despite good quality care and financial access, the waiting times are really long and have gotten worse along with rising, unsustainable budgets.\nWhat you call Medicare in many countries is actually managed competition through private insurance like in Netherlands or Germany which have more success. So why would you take private insurance away and adopt a single payer model? It would be infective, potentially bankrupt the government, take away patient choice of physicians, lead to longer waiting times, lead to job losses with the all the private insurance jobs of over a million people plus dependents. Also, almost all healthcare provision is in the private sector in US, they have to be profitable or shut down. In the UK, Canada and Denmark, most of the healthcare provision is public sector, so they don’t have to turn a profit. Joe can enhance and improve Obamacare with clear caps on out of pocket spendings and deductibles, pricing regulations on medical services, premium regulations on insurance plans and controlling prices of medications and supplies while substituting for generics like Germany\nIn all honesty Joe Biden has the best plan and best chance of success to enhance Obamacare and address the challenges in healthcare in a manner that’s realistic.', 'Who are all of these people who want to keep their current health insurance?

As recently has a couple of weeks ago we heard campaign workers of color launching a complaint against Mayor Pete and his campaign for their unfair treatment in South Bend, Indiana.

As the years tick by we have been turning more purple and it's been proven with the Beto vs Cruz election. My boyfriend moved in with my mom and i to help pay my student loan debt as well as his debt from other things so we could move out together. My mom would allow us to pay less than an apartment would so we could save up faster than if we lived separately. But we've had an car accident that's taken out money from us as well as a tornado out of nowhere hitting our neighborhood and put us in even more debt. I've had to change my loan payment plan for school so that I don't have to pay them back yet but I know at least $2000 has been added in interest since my grace period ended. And I still cant begin to pay it back because the tornado took out a lot of our money because we needed a new roof and fence. I had to use the tax money I had set aside (I'm 10-99 so I pay my own taxes) to help pay my debts off. Now I'm more worried about making sure my taxes get paid (because the IRS is scarier than my student loans) and we were supposed to have moved out already. We had created a plan of how much money we needed. We now owe ourselves an extra $2600 on top of saving up to move out. If I didnt have my student loans I would have so much relief. We were debating just starving off of his paycheck so I could dedicate my complete paychecks for maybe a year to pay off my loans.

The safety of our democracy is more important than shareholder dividends and CEO salaries. And as president, I'll take a series of actions to further address the spread of disinformation.

The stakes of this election are too high. We need to fight the spread of false information that disempowers voters and undermines democracy.

And I've got a plan for that.

I know how to get our government working for the people because I’ve done it before. In 2010, President Obama picked me to get the CFPB up and running. We recruited a mission-driven staff and set up the organization, and it acted swiftly to protect Americans from financial predators.

On day one of my presidency, I will take aggressive steps to root out the corruption and incompetence of the Trump administration and to hold that administration accountable, starting by removing all political appointees except those positions necessary to preserve continuity and protect national security during the transition period. I will also direct the Justice Department to establish an independent task force to investigate violations of specific anti-corruption and public integrity laws during the Trump administration, with independent authority to pursue any substantiated violations.
I'll move swiftly to appoint new personnel who will undo the Trump administration's disastrous policies, and I'll adopt the strictest anti-corruption hiring rules of any administration in American history. I'll appoint people who want to fulfill their agency's mission, not undermine it. And I'll build a Cabinet and senior leadership team that reflects the full diversity of America.

I had the chance to visit the site of the Tulsa Race Massacre—a terrible chapter in our nation's history.
While we can never undo this hateful act of domestic terrorism or the pain and suffering it inflicted on the Black community, we all must do our part to dismantle the legacy of systemic racism and oppression that was left in its wake—and that starts with justice and opportunity.
The men responsible for killing hundreds of innocent African Americans committed an act of domestic terrorism, but they were never held accountable. The search for the victims’ mass graves continues to this day, as does the domestic terrorism threat of white nationalism. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat white nationalist violence and associated acts of terror.
Black Wall Street was defined by the human spirit. So the community was rebuilt relatively quickly, peaking in the 1940s. But it declined in the sixties and seventies because of gentrification and failure to have a systematic mentorship process in place.

For generations, the federal government has prevented African Americans from building wealth and financial security. It's time for our government to acknowledge its actions and step in to make opportunity available for African American communities. And we do that by investing in Black Americans and creating opportunity. The fights for social, racial, and economic justice belong to all of us—and when I’m president, that truth will inform our policies and our actions.","['💗', '🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍', '🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍', 'We need to make sure that our History is still taught in school so that we can insure that it never happens again.', '❤️#NewSupporter', 'Forget the wound, the bone is infected', 'Never forget!', 'Thank you for sharing my home town, @elizabethwarren! #tulsa #oklahoma', 'EW, I love you so much', 'I didn’t even hear about this in US history class bruh... have you? @_yaya.west', '❤️', 'Greenwood was one of the most prosperous communities in America period( not just most prosperous black communities), there were more high rise buildings there than many other towns run by whites who were getting federal funding.

Elizabeth Warren,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7TYtgJH2DO/,image,"We have a student loan crisis—and we can't afford to wait for Congress to act. I’ve already proposed a student loan debt cancellation plan, and on day one of my presidency, I’ll use existing laws to start providing that debt cancellation immediately.
When I was elected to the Senate, I used every opportunity and tool available to ease the burden of student debt. I fought to lower interest rates, refinance loans, and hold loan servicers and debt collectors accountable for breaking the law and hurting borrowers. I made sure Congress provided $700 million in a relief fund for borrowers who dedicated their lives to public service but missed technical requirements for loan forgiveness, and I fought to cancel loans for 80,000 students who were cheated by Corinthian Colleges.

Understand this: The Department of Education has broad authority to end the student loan debt crisis. When I'm president, I plan to use that authority. I will also use all the tools available to me to address the racial disparities in higher education, crack down on for-profit institutions, and eliminate predatory lending.

The future of our economy and a generation of student loan borrowers are at risk, and we must use every tool and opportunity we have to help them. We can't let corruption in Washington hold back big, structural change. I’m committed to seeing this fight through—no matter what. Check out the link in my bio to see how we’ll do it.","['🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍', '🐍', 'Ah yes just screw over everyone who really saved and paid for college.

I live in a very blue state and this last election a republican, who I voted for, got fairly close to being our next governor because dems are just moving too far left and most of us just want a sensible candidate who doesn’t push far left or far right policies. And I agree with this man. I think the priority should be lowering the cost of education at public colleges, removing the interest from all loan programs, existing and future, and perhaps allowing us to write off the principle payments on our taxes, rather than a drastic bandaid solution such as canceling all debt. I earn an average income and I pay hundreds per month above the minimum to pay down my loans in order to get rid of them quickly.

My move was not intended to be permanent [truth be told, I came to Germany to study because it’s ridiculously affordable (I mean, if you’re gonna get a degree in whatever, you should be at least able to afford it, right?)], but one thing lead to the next and I learned a trade and started a family.

Elizabeth Warren,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7BYea1ngl-/,image,"I spent most of my career studying why American families go broke. What I discovered was that they weren't reckless or irresponsible—they were being squeezed by an economy that forced them to take on more debt, and one bad break sent them tumbling over the edge. Right now, our bankruptcy laws make it harder for struggling families to get back on their feet. That's not right. So today, I’m sharing my plan to overhaul our consumer bankruptcy rules.

My plan will make it easier for people being crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy by streamlining the process, reducing the costs of filing, and giving people more flexibility in bankruptcy to find solutions that match their financial problems. I’ll expand people’s rights to take care of themselves and their children while they are in the bankruptcy process, and let them protect their homes and cars in bankruptcy so they can rebuild their financial lives. I’ll end the absurd rules that make it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, and address the shameful racial and gender disparities that plague our bankruptcy system. And I’ll close the loopholes that allow the wealthy and corporate creditors to abuse the bankruptcy system at the expense of everyone else.
The banking industry wants you to believe people who file for bankruptcy are reckless or irresponsible. The truth is that they're struggling with rising costs and flat wages. One crisis is enough to send them over the edge. They don’t need shaming. They need relief.  Read my full plan at the link in the bio.","['I love you!!!', 'I’ve filed bankruptcy once.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the ADA, and although we've made significant progress, we still have a lot of ground left to cover. As president, protecting the rights and equality of people with disabilities will be a top priority.
My administration will partner with the disability community to fight ableism and for justice across all aspects of life. Together, we’ll fight for economic security for individuals with disabilities, ensuring they can participate fully in the economy, receive fair wages, and have financial security for all. We’ll support children with disabilities and their families by providing crucial early interventions and ensuring meaningful access to education. We’ll ensure that technology is used to advance the interests of people with disabilities—not to discriminate against them.

From criminal justice to voting, immigration, and protecting parents with disabilities from discrimination, we’ll safeguard the rights and civil liberties of people with disabilities and work to ensure that our society and democracy are truly inclusive. We’ll promote affordable, accessible, and green housing and strengthen anti-discrimination protections. We’ll fight for #MedicareForAll to ensure that everyone has affordable, high quality health care. And the United States will lead the fight for disability rights around the world.

President Trump on Friday signed the nearly $500 billion “Phase 3.5” emergency interim coronavirus relief package into law after Congress passed legislation this week replenishing the fund for small businesses and adding billions of dollars in aid to hospitals across the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

⁣The new interim emergency relief package, which provides $484 billion in additional funding, passed the House on Thursday and the Senate earlier this week.

He added, “And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning … it would be interesting to check that.”', ""He saved america once he'll save it again"", 'Trump’s Lies are a deadly serious matter. Candidate Trump in 2016 was a private citizen and could and did lie about most everything, however, public servant Trump, an employee of the U.S. Federal Government over the past 3 years cannot lie as each instance is a Conspiracy to Defraud the Public, a criminal felony and as his lies impact people’s lives, the civil cases will also be heard in court. Trump’s continued lies and creative fabrications regarding COVID-19 are crimes against humanity. What individual is willing to lie about the details of a world-wide pandemic? He is directly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. citizens.\nWe have built a legal assistant website with bots that file criminal complaints and civil actions against Trump for every citizen who has witnessed by video or in-person his most blatant lies (~1,500). Each victim shares how the lies have negatively impacted their lives and businesses.\n\nWe estimate 100 million citizens will file 3,000 court cases each (criminal and civil) demanding an average of $100,000 per civil action and $100,000 each in criminal fines.\n\nThis totals 300 billion court cases which will result in 3 quadrillion dollars in fines and court ordered settlements.\n\nThe courts will certainly demand the filings be combined into class actions, and many will, however, it can be easily argued that one of Trump’s lies has impacted citizens in radically different ways which provides the justification to hear the cases separately.

But I think the reason is because we have a great effective cocktail of drugs that allows patients to live a relatively normal life. Therefore I think we should be focusing on drug therapies. It seems like we have several candidates already having very good results. If we can mitigate the symptoms and fatality rate of this virus then I think we have won.

He used his Gates and Melinda Foundation as a charitable tax loophole avoiding taxation on his Microsoft shares. His private doctor from 1990s revealed at a conference with other doctors that Gates refused to vaccinate his own children when they were young. India cut funding ties with Gates Foundation on immunization in the country because Bill Gates was using it to influence policy making in the country and Indian health experts claimed those receiving Gates foundations sponsored vaccines during their reproductive age were having infertility issues or if able to get pregnant the baby would come out with abnormalities. Bill Gates tried to steal the shares of his partner and co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen, while he was dying from cancer. He is an advocate of GMOs (buying big number if shares in Monsanto) even though genetically modified foods have been linked GMOs to cancer. On many different occasions he’s said he thinks the world is over populated and there should be a way to stop population growth especially in certain areas of the world. So you want to tell me someone with that belief cares about helping save lives by vaccination? He’s been friends with Warren Buffet for 30 years, having each other on speed dial, Buffet purchased half a billion dollar worth of shares in Kroger (Ralph’s groceries) in early February. While the economy is taking a hit due to covid-19, grocery store stocks are going up up up. Honestly I can write on this for days.

The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed. You can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 with these actions: Practice social distancing by putting space between yourself and others, avoid close contact with people who are sick, wash hands often for at least 20 seconds, and avoid touching your face. Stay safe and healthy during the COVID-19 outbreak. www.cdc.gov/coronavirus

I recommend all big places such as Airports, Stores, Restaurants, Schools, etc all shut down, closed. The only advise to everybody to avoid not get SARS is I will say stay home, stay away from other people with Sars, avoid crowd people, wear masks everyday outside, wash hand, clean up. Everyday and every Countries all talking about Coronavirus because it's very big importance news and each day have death tolls counts of how people died each day and each Countries but that is not going to work for only just talking and not do something about SARS and it no use just think about these everyday about disappointment situations. Even though many Countries made a decision of abandoned all travellers come visit their Countries, but the SARS still have at another Country. First of all where is very first Country start Sars from, it was from China and wild animals. Well the very first Country have do something first. The people not from China with SARS they were not very first people get it. Even doctors, nurses, can't do anything something the people with SARS. They only can help fix people's body. There is no medication for SARS at this point. I suggest if the resident people want to come back to their own Country after came from visit another Country they have to get check up by Airport medical staffs check if they get virus from another Country. If they have SARS they can't go home they to stay in the airport or hospital for one to two weeks recoveries. If checked they came back from trip no SARS they can go home. If new people want immigrant to new Countries, the government will have to say no accept new immigrant at this point because of SARS will have to wait longer. Other ways to stop continue to have SARS is the very first Country China have SARS have to do something and stop first have SARS I recommend get rid burn and fire kill the wild animals SARS."", 'The risk to Americans is very low?

Donc étant un cadre bien officiel et surtout bien encadré du PP4PP comme aussi des autres pays du monde, il s'impose donc que le Président Tshisekedi mette en place les conditions ci haut de leur Libre exploitations de certains sites miniers et agricoles avec l'encadrement et la formation du programme de la lutte contre la pauvreté.. ils se sentent libre de leurs affaires et de lever toutes formes de contraintes particulières mises en place par l'ancien régime et leurs complices chinoises et autres.. pour un bon climat de travail et exploitations comme c'était à l'époque..

Today, we launched a brand new nationwide campaign to revitalize under-served cities and towns across America – it’s called OPPORTUNITY NOW!","['ترامپ فقط خودتو عشقه😍🤣', 'گه نخور', '❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏', ""Selon les experts US, il y aurait de minerais du genre Lithium, Coltan, or et autres dans la contrée du Kasaï en masse allant de Tshikapa à Muene ditu en passant par Tshimbulu, Kananga, Lac Munkamba, Kabeya Kamwanga et Mbuji Mayi qui seraient totalement mélangés avec le diamant de joelleries et industriels... 12 sacs de coltan appartenant aux diamentaires Kasaïens seraient venus de Mbuji Mayi en provenance de contrées allant de Mbuji Mayi à Muene ditu dans la zone de 120 Km qui les séparent de cette ville diamentaire.. pour Kinshasa et on aurait pris cet échantillon pour un labo des USA pour une étude de teneur comme de spécificités minérales.. après un moment d'études.. Le labo a bien confirmé qu'il s'agit non seulement de coltan mais d'une grande teneur enrichissante mais surtout serait en mélange avec les autres minerais dont le diamant (car les traces de Kimberlite s'y retrouve dans ses sacs de minerais artisanaux comme de Lithium).. même cas de figure a été faite avec de minerais tests toujours de c diamantaires artisanaux venant de Kabeya Kamwanga comme de Tshimbulu.. Coltan, Lithium, Or et Diamant sur les contrées du Kasaï en allant de la route nationale numéro 1 venant de Kinshasa & Kikwit.. dès Tshikapa montant vers Tshimbulu, Kananga, Munkamba, Kabeya Kamwanga, Mbuji Mayi, Muene ditu... comme de l'autre part de Luiza, Ngandajika, Kabinda, Lussambo.. Selon les différents échantillons de c spécialistes.. Il y aurait des énormes et immenses réserves de minerais rares en Lithium, Coltan, Or et autres mais mélangé souvent avec les terres diamentiferes du Grand Kasaï en Kimberlite.. Donc l'exploration et l'exploitation de c minerais rares du Kasaï (qui étaient à la base de troubles de Kamwena Nsapu entre la Kabilie et les chefs coutumiers du Kasaï qui ne voulaient du déplacement de leurs populations pour y remplacer par ceux qui venaient d'ailleurs et de l'étranger pour exploiter les Coltan, Lithium, Or et Diamant et autres de leurs terres) impose que le Président Tshisekedi donne à la MIBA, une autre dimension d'exploitation de c grande région du Kasai (c' déjà le cas sur les papiers car toutes les zones minérales du G Kasaï sont c propriété d'exploitation)"", ""Donc excepté la prospection d'ordre général de la Team US pour les dossiers d'ordre diplomatic et sécuritaire pour l'ouverture d'un grand bureau permanent de l'ambassade des USA à Mbuji Mayi comme d'un grand American center pour les jeunes du Kasaï.. mais aussi de la visite de l'école de formation des officiers du Congo dûment la coopération Militaire USA & RDC de Kananga comme du site opérationnel des instructeurs US et une petite Troop.. Il s'impose donc que les choses soient mises au clair car toute cette région est très riche en minerais rares qui valent la révolution technologic d c 21e siècle au même titre que le Kivu et le Katanga (plus riche en minerais ordinaires de tous genres excepté sa plus grande réserve de colbalt et l'uranium de haute portée de teneur qu'on en trouve également au Kasaï ) mais le Kasaï et le Kivu sont énormément riche en minerais rares de la génération numérique.. et dans cette même contrée du Kasaï, on en trouve le Gaz et le pétrole sur la rivière Lubi ou Lubilaji dont on estimerait les réserves à entre 4 à 9 milliards de barils de pétrole (le fameux bloc 12) comme de plusieurs milliards volumes de metre cube de Gaz.. Ça serait la 1e contrée lointaine de l'interieur de la RDC en savane et très accessible à l'exploitation énergétique de Gaz et pétrole après celle de Kayemba dans le sud de la province de Bandundu à la frontière avec l'Angola qui est aussi en Savane comme en rivière là de Kayemba vers Tshikapa, car le long de la route nationale numéro 1 venant de Banana & Mbuji Mayi & Kasumbalesa.."", ""Selon tous les experts US, ils pensent donc que le Président Tshisekedi se doit de lancer les joint venture avec les multinationales US dans le cadre du PP4PP avec la MIBA pour l'ouverture de grands sites miniers dans divers coins du Grand Kasaï pour l'exploitation minière industrielle du Lithium, Coltan, Or et diamant.. la tâche la plus difficile c de séparer c minerais rares la plus part de cas avec les diamants en masse industrielle comme de joellerie et l'or.. parfois avec les cassitérites, calcaires, malaquite.. La MIBA n'a pas encore ces technologies de pointe.. Il importe qu'il ouvre bien la porte à de compagnies de grandes tailles pour exploiter quelques sites miniers et garder d'autres pour les générations avenirs comme le signifier le code minier et refaire de la MIBA l'un de geants miniers d'Afrique avec les minerais rares et précieux comme également avec la SONAHYDRO, société nationale des hydrocarbures.. ça sera la même chose pour la Société minière du Kivu (SOMINKI) qui est également un géant minier en terme de minerais rares et de l'or excepté le diamant qu'on en trouve qu'au Kasaï en immense réserve industrielle.. Donc en applicant une bonne politique minière de savoir préserver celles de l'avenir.. comme celle à l'exploitation.. Le Président Tshisekedi pourra renouer de joint venture avec les multinationales du monde dont celles des USA pour la Gecamines, la Minière de Bakwanga, La société minière du Kivu.. et rapidement placer le Congo au Top minier non seulement de l'Afrique mais du monde entier comme c'était bien le cas en 1950 avec l'arrivée du Président Eisenhower à la WH qui avait su mettre en symbiose les immenses riches de l'État US (Congo belge y compris) pour la construction de l'industrie économique des USA comme de l'Amérique.. laquelle de logique Reagan avait aussi mener en bien en introduisant la notion de l'environnement pour mieux protéger les autres réserves en fond de l'avenir et d'autres en propulsions du présent.."", ""Sur ce, les experts US voient la levée de frais de visa non immigrant comme un grand avantage pour le Congo et USA.. car l'administration US met en place les conditions économiques devant permettre au Made in USA d'être commercer dans les pays développer, émergents comme aussi ou dites pauvres... On constate que les Congolais voyagent pour la Chine en Guanzu pour acheter les marchandises à bon prix et venir les vendre à Kinshasa.. d'autres ont ouvert la voie vers la Turquie mais avant c'était vers Dubaï.. Ils achètent toutes formes de marchandises et de divers secteurs commerciaux jusqu'à devenir de Chino dépendant en terme de produits industriels ou de Turco dépendant (un peu de baisse à cause de l'immigration illegale vers l'Europe via la Turquie).. En effet, les experts US pensent que c conditions de créer un State US sanctuarisé qui serait comme Guanzu ou UAE (Dubaiï) comme Turquie pour le commerce de tous les produits manufacturiers, industriels, numériques et autres de Made in USA de bonnes qualités mais pour les régions du sud dont l'Afrique et l'Asie comme aussi parfois l'Amérique latine.. un State ou deux même 3 sanctuarisés economiquement via de mesures importantes et imposantes de l'économie pour le commerce via la production de Made in USA pour ces commerçants (businessman ou woman) venant de c régions dont de la RDC avec sa montée en terme de revenus grâce aux multiples investissements US.. Il y aura une forte demande de vies intermédiaires dont les matériels électro managers, les automobiles, les habits de luxe et de marque comme de bonnes qualités ainsi que de masse, de produits numériques comme de Phones, ordinateurs portables, tablettes et autres, produits agro alimentaire etcc.. Made in USA.. Facilement avec un frais administratif de 30 $ et un billet promotionnel comme le PP4PP avec Accord commercial USA & RDC.. un businessWoman peut venir aux USA dans le State sanctuarisé acheté de produits de divers genres à bon prix et revenir au Congo pour en vendre en gros dans ses établissements en cassant via les habits et baskets, chaussures.. neufs de Magazins : les fripperies et les pirates venant de contre facteur.."", ""Même aussi de IPhone bon prix comme Ordinateur bon prix pour les pays émergents et dites en voie de l'émergence (pauvres)... justement pour casser les contre facteurs et les pirates et promouvoir les Made in USA et les placer dans le monde avec une forte balance commerciale positive des USA.. Déjà avec la RDC, il est fort possible avec un bon contrôle de l'immigration de voyages des affaires que dans c State spécial que les Made in USA inonde les marchés congolais et même que les compagnies US produisent leurs marques aux USA et viennent les monter en RDC surplace par exemple, les automobiles, les Phones et tablettes, les électro managers de tout genre etc et à partir du Congo qui est un marché en puissance de +90 millions des gens (en voie de 90 millions selon le PNUD.. pour l'instant) de quoi avec ces augmentations de son IDH (indice de développement humain) qu'on puisse avec des échanges RDC & USA se plaçaient à plusieurs milliards dans les prochains jours.. et que le Congo soit le 1e pays consommateur de Made in USA avec aussi une montée en flèche de touristes US au Congo et même des résidents US au Congo comme c'était à l'époque du Congo belge avec des américains juifs et autres au Kasaï, Katanga, Kivu surtout.. Ils voient cette approche de la lavée d c 250 $ comme une grande porte pour le commerce à grande échelle.. Il est bien évident avec le retour en force de minerais au Kasaï avec le Luba dont le Diamant et l'or via la MIBA et même artisanaux par la levée de mesures politiciennes de la Kabilie de leurs interdire d'exploiter les minerais mais aussi de Kivu avec les Nande et les autres comme aussi le Katanga avec le Luba toujours que leurs coopératives via l'encadrement de l'État comme des organisations internationales dong Usaid pour la lutte contre les minerais de conflits qu'ils puissent ou qu'on puisse voir un retour en force des hommes d'affaires Congolais qui seront même prêt à créer de Boutiques Nike, Reebook, Raph Lauren.. etc par exemple au Congo dont à Mbuji Mayi, Kananga, Lubumbashi et autres.. ou de Véhicules du types US etc..

Nancy Pelosi ripped up my father's speech last night.

In that speech were stories of American Heroes and American Dreams. Sacrifice and honor. Men and women who gave everything for this country. These are their stories: - A Young Boy aspiring to be a Hero, like his Great Grandfather. - A Soldier returning home to his family. - Dreams coming true for young Americans. - Honoring a Gold Star Family who gave everything. - A Young Girl surviving against all odds.
Pelosi RIPPED these stories IN HALF.
Pelosi hates President Donald J. Trump more than she loves America. What a bitter woman. Their stories are more powerful than her hate.

Sur le plan politique, cela rassemble l'Amérique autour d'un objectif majeur que sauver les vies des américains et de nos agents et soldats dans le monde comme de nos consultants et contractants 1e puis de tous nos partenaires privilégiés et Alliés dans le monde.. comme aussi de bonnes relations avec de pays comme la Chine, l'Iran, le Japon, la Corée du sud et autres.."", ""Certainement, sur le plan politique.. Tous les deux partis politiques en profitent chacun à son niveau car il y a aussi de Gouverneurs Républicains et Démocrates.. de quoi s'y mettre à fin pour mettre en sécurité l'économie des USA et du monde d'une manière générale et relancer la production mondiale à grand pas en réduisant largement ces risques d'ordre sanitaire majeur.."", ""Par ailleurs, les experts US rappellent qu'il importe que USA puisse reste bien focus sur son agenda en RDC car sa mise en oeuvre met fin à l'érosion économique des USA comme du monde en général.. ainsi il suggère avec insistance qu'un contingent de Troops puissent déjà être à la suite ou précède le retour du Président TSHISEKEDI à Kinshasa après son déplacement à DC et que les mesures de sécurité soient de très haut niveau pour endiguer toutes formes de choses allant dans un autre comme un autre.. et directement de se mettre au travail selon la feuille de route du PP4PP de la réouverture de la Grande Base US comme de ses sites ainsi que de ses options fondamentales de formations et professionnalisation des Armées US.. de rappeler au Président TSHISEKEDI que les disparitions des hauts responsables de sécurité relève d'une autre part d'une stratégie de ralentir ses nominations dans les Forces de Défense et de sécurité via de subterfuges rocambolesques.. Il importe donc et c'est cela la solution idoine et très efficace que le Chef de l'État Congolais passe à de nominations dans les FARDC, PNC et dans les corps de services de renseignement du pays dans son ensemble... La solution ne se doit de ne pas tarder mais se faire aussi rapidement que possible par le Ministre de l'intérieur et celui de la Défense nationale via les ordonnances du Chef de l'État en créant en même temps un corps de responsables de sécurité et de défense de nouvelles tournures et visions..

De les prendre avec force détails et d'y mettre terme.. de parler à Fasthi étant deja sur place au Congo via les Troops US à la Réforme générale de Forces de defense et sécurité avant l'arrivée du Secrétaire d'État à Kinshasa pour le lancement du PP4PP.. et aux spécialistes US d'entamer avec les experts Congolais le démantèlement du réseau numérique 5 G de la Chine dans le pays pour restaurer la souveraineté numérique du Congo pour une mise en place de celle qui est bien conforme aux droits de souveraineté numérique comme de Cyber sécurité et défense..."", ""D'assoir pleinement l'institution Président de la RDC par ses multiples nominations et mises en place durant le mois de février et mars par leurs entrées en fonction pour une prise TOTALE de l'Imperium de l'État et des Réformes de l'appareil du pays sous toutes ses formes.. afin de maîtriser tous les aspects de la vie nationale et fructifier les partenariats extérieurs de la RDC comme aussi du Congo & USA par un grand vent du Changement de logiciel (vision) de l'Etat..

Cela nécessite que les bases US partout dans le monde puissent relever les niveaux de sécurités sanitaires et vacciner si possible tous les Troops extérieurs des USA selon les prescrits des experts en science du domaines de Pentagone.. et les mêmes disponitions pour la base US au Congo en mettant en place les mêmes disponitions drastiques et vacciner les Troops d'élites ou Commando en question.. et d'en faire de même pour ceux de pays partenaires dont FARDC et PNC comme service de renseignements (Réformés) pour endiguer toutes formes d'embuches des adversaires des USA quelqu'en soit la forme.."", ""Les memes recoupements leurs permettent de parler de la 5 G qui fonctionne comme un esprit avec de fonctionnalité très pointue.. que l'homme n'a jamais encore atteint.. dont la Chine aurait pour objectif d'établir en Occident comme dans le monde via la ceinture et routes pour dominer les flux des informations et la numérique mondiale puis assoir sa grande puissance mondiale.. Ils l'ont essayé avec les +1 milliards de leurs populations, cela a réussi, ils se disent qu'ils peuvent le réitérer ou le reimplater dans le monde et réussir à le conquérir et le dominer rapidement et sans obstacle.. De la sorte, ils ont besoin du Congo pour le réussir et serait aussi soutenue par certains pays (qui serait des alliés des USA de façades).. objectif que la Chine détrône USA sur le plan de puissance mondiale afin que nous réussirons à établir un seul Parti dominateur avec son modèle politique général.. Pas de démocratie ni de Libertés mais plutôt de lavage de cerveaux et de soumissions aux chants et dévouements aveugles et béants.. Cela dit, Ils pensent que USA se doit de tout faire pour signer avec UK un Deal commercial global afin d'endiguer ce projet chinois de 5G espionneur et voie de domination des peuples du monde via leurs flux des informations.."", ""Un Deal commercial USA & UK permettra aux deux pays de réussir à mettre en place un grand système rassurant et rassembler de mesures de sécurité numérique immense pour une totale transparence numérique et rassurer aux deux pays comme aux pays du monde de la souveraineté numérique via la Cyber sécurité.. beaucoup des experts US rejoignent les propositions de certains spécialistes Israéliens qui ont parlé de la mise en place des intelligences artificielles de sécurité numérique très avancées avec de droits numériques garantis pour une bonne utilisation de la 5G par les grandes populations du monde en toute liberté garantie par les droits humains et de l'homme.. mais aussi de la souveraineté de Nations de la Charte de Nations Unies.. Donc le Deal global USA & UK va s'implanter dans le Common Wealth aussi facilement et garantir à ces pays du monde la 5 G+ à bon prix mais avec la souveraineté numérique garantie à 100%.. via de techniques (intelligences artificielles avancées) et de droits numériques de la Cyber sécurité.. Voilà pourquoi, les experts US pensent que USA a un grand défi pour ses élections d 2020 avec cette immense technologie 5 G dont la Chine n'utilise pas à bon escient mais en use pour compromettre la souveraineté des autres Nations comme leurs libertés.. d'une part et de l'autre les compagnies de composites US de très hautes technologies doivent très bien s'aviser pour leurs connaissances en la matières.. Ainsi, les experts US pensent que after la signature USA & UK dont la rubrique Cyber sécurité (sécurité numérique et commerce digital) sera minutiesement traité et fourni.. avec la présence US (Base US) au Congo faisant échec à tout complot contre le Congo et son régime démocratique en appuyant la réforme de l'appareil de son État de fond en comble en deboulonnant le système d'espionnage 5 G et les services parallèles ou étrangers dans le pays tout changeant le système de sécurité nationale complétement.. que ça soit la Chine et l'Union européenne comme l'Inde viendront signer le Deal commercial et traiter de question fondamentale de la Cyber sécurité de la 5G.. ainsi on verra la Chine signer la phase 2 et de l'autre l'UE aussi le Deal complet.."", ""De même que l'Inde.. Cependant, les experts US pensent qu'il sied que USA entame d'abord les travaux de fiabilisation de ses bases US dans le monde en terme de sécurité numérique et comme des pays alliés du Moyen Orient comme de ses stationnements strategics.. d'une manière méthodique et systémique car il y en a d'autres personnes aux USA qui soutiennent à ce que la Chine puisse réussir son plan via de sentiments anti patriotique qui effleuré exactement la haute trahison.. Cela nécessite que le Pentagon soit intransigeant en la matière de haut en bas comme les autres contours de choses.. et aider les pays du Balkans à ne pas du tout tomber dans le piège de la 5 G sournoise par de très bonne mesures de Cyber sécurité et droits numériques pour se rassurer une souveraineté numérique totale.."", ""Aux grands spécialistes des Offices US d'entamer les travaux de la 6 G et de la 7 G d'ici à 2035 car les puissances et les courses des intelligences artificielles prennent de contours absolus et protéger les connaissances rigoureusement.. la raison même du Deal USA & UK.. devant obliger à la Chine de se conformer aux prescrits de sécurité numérique avec le monde afin que ses compagnies Lenovo, ZTE, Huawei aient la voie libre de commercer et travailler dans le monde.. ainsi, ils vont signer le Deal phase 2 et réussir à avoir la bonne ouverture et bien encadrée les choses pour le bien de tous.. Les peuples du monde ne sont pas de centres de ouighours via la 5 G.. pour contrôler leurs intellects comme entendements.. Nous sommes dans un monde de Libertés et de droits de peuples.. C'est un grand défi du 21e siècle : comment combiner la numérique et les Libertés humaines ? La réponse c'est la Cyber sécurité très avancée.."", 'I love you iran', 'حرام زادع']","Jan 17, 2020",2020-01-17T19:12:35.000Z,"707,347","146,831"

Il est bien venu que USA puisse prendre les devants de concrétiser comme les autres pays de l'Amérique ladite réforme de l'ensemble de son pays et propulser ladite réforme dans le monde auprès de ses alliés en parfaite coopération avec le Vatican qui en est bien l'initiateur..

Ça sera de même qu'avec cette formation de liberté maritale pour les prêtres catholiques devant élaguer à la racine l'image des hypocrites et de scandales qui entament l'intégrité de la foi catholique..mais aussi les experts US voient l'occasion pour USA de prôner la liberté de religions avec le Vatican partout dans le monde mais aussi avec Mecque dans les prochains jours comme les orthodoxes et anglicans.. pour réussir à contrecarrer le radicalisme religieux mais surtout dans islamique et autres dans le monde.. en particulier dans les pays latines, se battre à fond avec ses grzndes intelligences pour empêcher et bloquer par un grand mur des stratégies et techniques idoines et conventionnelles la montée de l'islamiste radical (Terrorisme).. en aucun cas s'établir dans les Amériques disons dans le sud des USA !"", 'De le combattre à fond en pointant sérieusement toutes formes de foyers islamique radicaux y relatifs dans ses régions... les anticiper et les détruire méthodiquement..', ""Les experts US pensent qu'il serait idéal que la Team US puisse clore leurs TALKS de la 2e phase avec la Chine via leurs TALKS par vidéo conférence devant faire l'objet du sommet de partenariat économique CHINA & USA pour ladite signature pour le bien de l'économie de deux pays mais aussi mondial.. car les subventions, les transferts forcés de technologies comme la Cyber sécurité sont de sujtes importants pour les grandes compagnies chinoises dont Huawei, ZTE et autres qui visent à s'épanouir dans le monde.. et cela passe par l'immense marché US.. Cela importe que la Cyber sécurité soit fondamentalement régler avec une précision de Génies.. Comme les subventions et transferts forcés y mettraient fins pour une concurrence loyale de quoi ouvrir la voie aussi aux investissements chinois dans le monde sans être soumises aux mêmes conditions.. dont USA.. Ainsi, la Chine a intérêt de sauver ses compagnies mais aussi de la levée complète de Tarriffs douaniers de part et d'autres de quoi ouvrir le commerce à nouveau et grandement dans le monde en boostant l'économie internationale.. par un grand Deal commercial..

Ils pensent que USA se doit de mener lui même la coordination sécuritaire en question au regard des enjeux en présence car ces adversaires usent de toutes formes de moyens dont la corruption pour arriver à leurs fins.. voyant bien qu'il a eu à respecter le Deal de 12 mois et qu'il relance son mandat avec un budget consistant et un agenda politique soutenu par de partenaires responsables.. cela dit, les experts US pensent que USA puisse mener en bien cette coordination sécuritaire avec UK de bout en bout sans pour autant laisser de côté une brèche.. Ils pensent que son vol se doit d'éviter la Libye d'une part et de l'autre de veiller à la traversée de la Manche ou du territoire aérien européen.. mais aussi ceux africain tout comme Congolais.. L'objectif demeure la sécurité à 100% dans l'ensemble du voyage afin que le 24 janvier, le PP4PP entame bel et bien sa mise en place avec propreté et soins pour le bien des USA et de l'EIC comme de l'ensemble du monde.. car une bonne croissance économique de l'OCDE, c'est un grand succès du commerce et économique international.. car l'histoire de l'attack de l'avion par l'Iran est un mauvais précédent pour l'aviation internationale en général qui nécessite vite que le monde puisse restaurer la sécurité aérienne et endiguer de tel genre de choses.. raison de plus à eviter le survol de la Libye.. d'aviser l'espace européen et africain via US services.."", ""Les experts US le répètent que cette semaine de procès d'impeachment qui s'ouvre, c'est une Week de grandes diversions et distractions politiques sur l'administration US afin de ne pas s'occuper sérieusement et attentivement de dossiers de sécurité nationale (géopolitiques) ou de géostratégie ( et/ou géo futuris selon le process) qui se posent au pays et à son peuple..

184 years ago, Texans gathered at Washington-on-the-Brazos to boldly declare independence from Mexico.
During this time, legends like William B. Travis, Jim Bowie, and Davy Crocket laid down their lives at the Alamo and inspired thousands of brave fighters to take up arms to free Texas from the oppressive regime of General Santa Anna. #texasindependenceday #texas🇨🇱 #texas
After General Sam Houston led the Texas Army to victory, he became the first President of the Republic of Texas.
His words – ‘govern wisely and as little as possible’ – still ring true today. Because the Lone Star State still follows this principle, Texas has become an economic powerhouse.
Thanks to limited government and ingenuity of hardworking Texans, the Lone Star State has one of the top performing economies in the nation and is consistently ranked the number one best state for business. The result? More jobs and higher wages.
Sam Houston and those he led risked everything to make freedom a reality for generations of Texans. Today, we celebrate and honor that sacrifice.

In my office, I have the busts of three transformative heroes: a bust of Winston Churchill, a bust of Ronald Reagan, and a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. All three fought for freedom, understood the power of words, and vision, and the power of speaking truth.

Dr. King urged America to honor its ‘sacred obligation' and he advocated for our inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And he courageously called on his fellow Americans, ‘to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.' Dr. King inspired men and women across the country and around the world.

He appealed to the soul of our nation and asked us to have ‘the courage to face the uncertainties of the future,' ‘as we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom.' From the dark cells of a Birmingham jail to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial - Dr. King spoke courageously and humbly he spoke out against inequality, against injustice. And his vision transformed America.

As we today honor the memory of Dr. King - of Reverend King - may we never forget our responsibility to pursue truth and justice as he did, and to work together to secure the blessings of liberty for every single American.","['Too bad you lack the integrity and courage Mitt Romney displayed today', '#mittromney is a real man that has no fear to do what is right.', 'Gentlemen know and be aware that in Iran girls and boys are men and women\nNon-Muslim Religious Non-Muslim Servant of the infidel\nWith veil and bad veil and no veil\nWe are unanimously Iranian from all walks of life\nAnd we are aware of your hostility to our beliefs\nYou who want a Zionist world\nKnow that the promise of our Lord is true, and it shall take hold of you\nWait for that day and the horror will be with you even in bed.', 'Attacking mitt Romney for upholding his sworn duty... throwing a decorated lieutenant out of the White House.

For months, the American people have been lectured on the critical urgency of impeaching President Trump. For more than three weeks, Nancy Pelosi dragged her feet, refusing to send the Articles over to the Senate. The reason is that the Articles fail to meet the constitutional standard for impeachment. They do not allege a single crime was committed – not even a speeding ticket.
It’s been disheartening to watch House Democrats subject our constitutional process and the President to relentless abuse and partisan gamesmanship for blatantly political purposes. That pattern will not continue in the Senate.
Make no mistake; the Senate will give President Trump and the American people a fair trial. One that follows precedent and respects due process. Unlike the House, we will be fair, give both sides a full opportunity to present their case, and allow the President to defend himself. The Senate should do its job quickly.

Cruz GOES OFF on Senate Democrats whose political posturing is costing innocent American lives.,"['really great to see ted blaming a murder on politics.', '@magan_wiggins', '""The impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump’s domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine. The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation’s upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security."" - The Impeachment Inquiry Report.', '""At the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine’s President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President’s prioritization of his personal political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky’s appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for “a favor though”: two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts. Our investigation determined that this telephone call was neither the start nor the end of President Trump’s efforts to bend U.S. foreign policy for his personal gain. Rather, it was a dramatic crescendo within a months-long campaign driven by President Trump in which senior U.S. officials, including the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Acting Chief of Staff, the Secretary of Energy, and others were either knowledgeable of or active participants in an effort to extract from a foreign nation the personal political benefits sought by the President."" - The Impeachment Inquiry Report.', '""The investigation revealed the nature and extent of the President’s misconduct, notwithstanding an unprecedented campaign of obstruction by the President and his Administration to prevent the Committees from obtaining documentary evidence and testimony. A dozen witnesses followed President Trump’s orders, defying voluntary requests and lawful subpoenas, and refusing to testify. The White House, Department of State, Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Energy refused to produce a single document in response to our subpoenas. Ultimately, this sweeping effort to stonewall the House of Representatives’ “sole Power of Impeachment” under the Constitution failed because witnesses courageously came forward and testified in response to lawful process. The report that follows was only possible because of their sense of duty and devotion to their country and its Constitution."" - The Impeachment Inquiry Report.', '""Given the proximate threat of further presidential attempts to solicit foreign interference in our next election, we cannot wait to make a referral until our efforts to obtain additional testimony and documents wind their way through the courts. The evidence of the President’s misconduct is overwhelming, and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a stronger or more complete case of obstruction than that demonstrated by the President since the inquiry began. The damage the President has done to our relationship with a key strategic partner will be remedied over time, and Ukraine continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support in Congress. But the damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three branches of government, will be long-lasting and potentially irrevocable if the President’s ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked. Any future President will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing, malfeasance, or corruption, and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three."" - The Impeachment Inquiry Report.', '""The efforts to involve Ukraine in our 2020 presidential election were undertaken by a President who himself was elected in 2016 with the benefit of an unprecedented and sweeping campaign of election interference undertaken by Russia in his favor, and which the President welcomed and utilized. Having witnessed the degree to which interference by a foreign power in 2016 harmed our democracy, President Trump cannot credibly claim ignorance to its pernicious effects. Even more pointedly, the President’s July call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, in which he solicited an investigation to damage his most feared 2020 opponent, came the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress about Russia’s efforts to damage his 2016 opponent and his urgent warning of the dangers of further foreign interference in the next election. With this backdrop, the solicitation of new foreign intervention was the act of a president unbound, not one chastened by experience. It was the act of a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection."" - The Impeachment Inquiry Report.', '🌷👑', '@sentedcruz please,Tell the Democrats that the Iranian people do not want this cruel mullahs regime.🙏', 'Have you been gaining weight ted?', '😎', ""Now that's awesome.

America should consistently be a voice for freedom. We should be a voice for human rights. We should be a voice for democracy. Because that truth is powerful and it can transform the world. That’s also where an American free press and the USAGM come in play. Now to be clear, we don’t ask journalists to promote the viewpoint of the United States government. There are plenty of countries in the world where governments run their media, and the media is little more than a propaganda outlet for whatever the policy views are of the particular regime in power. Instead, we believe in a different kind of press, one that aligns with American principles. It’s a testament to our system of government that we encourage and protect dissent. That we encourage and protect a free media because freedom depends upon a free media.”","['👏👏👏 Let us hear all the facts on BOTH sides so we can make an INFORMED decision for our own self.', ""It's time to sue!

The manipulation and abuse of the single issue anti-abortion voters is perhaps the greatest con job ever pulled off in the history of American politics. Dwight Eisenhower appointed pro-choice Justices William Brennan (1956) and Potter Stewart (1958) to the Supreme Court. As Governor of California Ronald Reagan legalized abortion in the state when he signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act on June 14, 1967. Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York signed legislation legalizing abortion from a Republican controlled state legislature in 1970. President Richard Nixon appointed pro-choice Justices Warren Burger (1969), Harry Blackmun (1970), and Lewis Powell (1971) to the Supreme Court. Roe v. Wade was decided on January 22, 1973 with 5 Republican appointed Justices voting in favor of it (Brennan, Stewart, Burger, Blackmun and Powell). President Gerald Ford admitted to being pro-choice and made Nelson Rockefeller his Vice President. Ford appointed pro-choice Justice John Paul Stevens to the Supreme Court in 1975. Ronald Reagan appointed pro-choice Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981 who was also confirmed by a Republican controlled Senate. Reagan also appointed pro-choice Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988. George H.W. Bush appointed pro-choice David Souter to the highest court in 1990. Roe v. Wade was further solidified as precedence in Planned Parenthood v. Casey on June 29, 1992. Republican appointed Justices Blackmun, Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter voted in favor of the Casey decision that upheld Roe. The Republicans legalized abortion through the state legislative process and through case law in the federal courts. The fact that Republican politicians claim to oppose abortion is an example of extreme hypocrisy."", 'Donald Trump said - “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life” to New York Magazine in October 2002. Witness George Houraney says that Trump asked him to organize a calendar girl competition at Mar-a-Lago in which Trump and Epstein would be the only men present. A woman named Katie Johnson filed a lawsuit against Trump in June 2016 alleging she was raped by Trump at Epstein\'s Manhattan home during a party in 1994 when she was 13 years old. Virginia Roberts Giuffre was recruited to be an Epstein victim from Mar-a-Lago in 1999 when she was 16 years old. Epstein\'s brother Mark Epstein said he witnessed Donald Trump on Epstein\'s plane ""numerous times"". One of the exact dates that Trump flew on Epstein\'s plane was January 5, 1997. In March of 2000 Epstein flew on Trump\'s plane. When Epstein was arrested in 2005 he had multiple contact and emergency contact phone numbers for Donald Trump in his little black book. In 2008 Epstein\'s defense attorney Ken Starr negotiated an illegal plea deal with then U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta that would avoid prison time for Epstein. Donald Trump appointed Alexander Acosta to his cabinet as Secretary of Labor in 2017. Acosta had to resign because of the Epstein scandal. Yet in June 2019 Trump\'s Department of Justice headed by Attorney General William Barr declined to invalidate Starr and Acosta\'s non-prosecution agreement for Epstein that was ruled illegal by a federal judge.']","Jan 16, 2019",2019-01-16T15:24:26.000Z,NA,"7,141"

Congress has a clear mandate from the American people: secure the border and build the wall. Ensuring the safety and security of Texans is one of my top priorities.

Fourteen billion dollars will go a long way to secure our southern border, and hinder the illegal flow of drugs, weapons, and individuals.

The Space Frontier Act takes the critical step of continuing the operations and utilization of the International Space Station through 2030, ensures that the United States won’t cede low-Earth orbit to China, enacts meaningful reforms to modernize our nation’s launch and re-entry regulations, and streamlines nongovernmental Earth observation regulations.

Thank you @sentedcruz', ""How can the Republican party claim to be against abortion when it was the Republicans who basically legalized abortion in the first place? The manipulation and abuse of the single issue anti-abortion voters is perhaps the greatest con job ever pulled off in the history of American politics. Dwight Eisenhower appointed pro-choice Justices William Brennan (1956) and Potter Stewart (1958) to the Supreme Court. As Governor of California Ronald Reagan legalized abortion in the state when he signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act on June 14, 1967. Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York signed legislation legalizing abortion from a Republican controlled state legislature in 1970. President Richard Nixon appointed pro-choice Justices Warren Burger (1969), Harry Blackmun (1970), and Lewis Powell (1971) to the Supreme Court. Roe v. Wade was decided on January 22, 1973 with 5 Republican appointed Justices voting in favor of it (Brennan, Stewart, Burger, Blackmun and Powell). President Gerald Ford admitted to being pro-choice and made Nelson Rockefeller his Vice President. Ford appointed pro-choice Justice John Paul Stevens to the Supreme Court in 1975. Ronald Reagan appointed pro-choice Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981 who was also confirmed by a Republican controlled Senate. Reagan also appointed pro-choice Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988. George H.W. Bush appointed pro-choice David Souter to the highest court in 1990. Roe v. Wade was further solidified as precedence in Planned Parenthood v. Casey on June 29, 1992. Republican appointed Justices Blackmun, Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter voted in favor of the Casey decision that upheld Roe. The Republicans legalized abortion through the state legislative process and through case law in the federal courts. The fact that Republican politicians claim to oppose abortion is an example of extreme hypocrisy."", 'Donald Trump said - “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life” to New York Magazine in October 2002. Witness George Houraney says that Trump asked him to organize a calendar girl competition at Mar-a-Lago in which Trump and Epstein would be the only men present. A woman named Katie Johnson filed a lawsuit against Trump in June 2016 alleging she was raped by Trump at Epstein\'s Manhattan home during a party in 1994 when she was 13 years old. Virginia Roberts Giuffre was recruited to be an Epstein victim from Mar-a-Lago in 1999 when she was 16 years old. Epstein\'s brother Mark Epstein said he witnessed Donald Trump on Epstein\'s plane ""numerous times"". One of the exact dates that Trump flew on Epstein\'s plane was January 5, 1997. In March of 2000 Epstein flew on Trump\'s plane. When Epstein was arrested in 2005 he had multiple contact and emergency contact phone numbers for Donald Trump in his little black book. In 2008 Epstein\'s defense attorney Ken Starr negotiated an illegal plea deal with then U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta that would avoid prison time for Epstein. Donald Trump appointed Alexander Acosta to his cabinet as Secretary of Labor in 2017. Acosta had to resign because of the Epstein scandal. Yet in June 2019 Trump\'s Department of Justice headed by Attorney General William Barr declined to invalidate Starr and Acosta\'s non-prosecution agreement for Epstein that was ruled illegal by a federal judge.']","Sep 27, 2018",2018-09-28T02:53:03.000Z,"146,349","16,483"

Knowing this would happen, perhaps it\'s the real reason why Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) kept these allegations secret since July. Here is what we now know that we didn\'t just a few hours ago:\n\n1) The brother of Christine Blazey Ford worked for Fusion GPS. Wow, what a coincidence.\n\n2) Martha G. Kavanaugh, the mother of Brett Kavanaugh, was a Maryland district judge in 1996. She was the judge in a foreclosure case in which Christine Blasey Ford’s parents were the defendants. Martha Kavanaugh ruled against the parents of Christine Blasey Ford in the foreclosure case. Could there be residual resentment?\n\n3) Ford\'s lawyer is a big Democrat donor who was involved in the Clinton / Paula Jones case.\n\n4) Christine Blazey Ford is a far left professor and an open-borders activist who has signed anti-Trump immigration letters.\n5) She also deleted her social media accounts just before coming forward. I don\'t blame her for that, but what would her posts reveal?\n\n6) An ""online professor rating site"" has numerous reviews by from her students. Some say that they think she\'s crazy, and they were actually scared by her behavior.\n\nThere will be much more to come—trust me on that. —Jack Watts', 'Ted is for the United States and Texas while Beto is for socialism', '@count_rolandv @nic.olexo', 'حاجی پیج منو ببین', 'Absolutely yes always', 'Don’t talk to the nations people', '🐷', 'voteBETO💙']","Sep 18, 2018",2018-09-18T15:08:15.000Z,NA,"3,808"

Today, we honor their memory. We remember the men and women in the World Trade Center, and those first responders – firefighters, law enforcement officials, and Good Samaritans – who rushed to their aid. We remember the military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon whose important work continues to keep our country safe. And we remember the innocent passengers and crewmembers on those four flights, some of whom heroically sacrificed themselves to minimize the casualties on the ground.
As we honor those lost, and those who rushed into harm’s way to save others, we also reaffirm our commitment to defend America from radical Islamic terrorism.
After 17 years of conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere around the globe, we pause to express our deep gratitude for the service and sacrifice of our military and the intelligence community who work tirelessly to prevent additional attacks from occurring on our soil.
As our freedoms and very way of life came under attack, American courage and strength prevailed. May we never forget those lost, and the service of our brave men and women in uniform who continue to fight day and night to keep our nation free and secure.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus General of the World Health Organization since 2017. Tedros Minister of Health from 2005 to 2012 under Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.There he met former President Bill Clinton and began a close collaboration with Clinton and the Clinton Foundation and its Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI). He also developed a close relation with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. As health minister, Tedros would also chair the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria that was co-founded by the Gates Foundation. The Global Fund has been riddled with fraud and corruption scandals.Today the largest donors to the WHO are the Gates Foundation and its associated GAVI Alliance for vaccination. With backers like Gates and Clinton it was no surprise that Tedros went on, after a stint as Ethiopian Foreign Minister, to win the post of WHO Director-General, this despite being the first non-physician to hold the position. During Tedros’ three year campaign to win the WHO post he was charged with having covered up three major epidemics of cholera while health minister in Ethiopia, mislabeling the cases as “acute watery diarrhea” (AWD)—a symptom of cholera—in an attempt to play down the significance of the epidemics, charges he denied. As Minister of Health, Tedros was able to form a close relationship with prominent figures including former DNC-president Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
